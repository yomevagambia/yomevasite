            Youths’ Movement for Employment and Violence-free Africa (YoMEVA) is registered charitable organization comprising young people across The Gambia. It was established in August of 2017. It came to being after some youths of The Gambia deemed it fit that a youth group is needed to intervened to look into the two most important pillars of the development of every nation - sustainable peace and youth employment. Henceforth, a team of able and willing young people was set up to steer the affairs of the movement, with a strong membership working in tendon.

            The Youths’ Movement for Employment and Violence-free Africa (YoMEVA) has since its inception been operating independently to meet its goals. Several challenges were set and settled during short deadlines. It registers interested members in a designed process, with no discrimination of gender, age, religion or race.

            YoMEVA is intended to gradually expand its existence and operations across Africa. The headquarters shall be in The Gambia, and with sub-branches in other African countries. Plans and efforts are already made to get it registered  in other West African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria.
