In recognition of the importance of young people's involvement in the quest for a peaceful Africa, and as a youth organization with the self-tasked to work within the framework of SDG8, which seeks to attain a target to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment; and SDG16 which promotes peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, the Youths’ Movement for Employment and     Violence - free Africa ( YoMEVA ) decided to embark on a two week nationwide school outreach on peace advocacy. 


The primary goal was to have a dialogue with students and teachers on the importance of peace; and the maintenance of a peaceful for a tolerance society. The  theme being “Every Student is a Potential Peace Ambassador came as a result of the need to sensitise the younger generation on the importance of peace. This is part of the association’s goals - to achieve a Violence-free Africa.


The activity started on the 15th January, 2018, and ended 26th January 2018. Meanwhile, the advocacy covered 16 schools across the country reaching out to about five thousand (5000) students and two-hundred (200) teachers. Below is the list of schools visited:
- Abuko upper Basic School 
- Bakoteh Upper Basic School 
- Latrikunda Basic Cycle School 
- St. Joseph's Basic Cycle School 
- St. Theresa's Upper Basic School 
- Yunus English School 
- St. Matthew's Basic Cycle School 
- Tallinding Upper Basic School 
- Jinack Basic and Senior Secondary school 
- Yundum Barracks Upper Basic School 
- Bakau Upper Basic School 
- Unity Upper Basic School
- Farafenni Upper Basic School
- Farafenni Senior Secondary school 


Meanwhile, the advocacy was not limited to the schools only. The social media handles of the association was effectively and efficiently utilised in reaching out to thousands of young people through its Facebook page; Twitter @yomevaG; and WhatsApp with a uniform message of Peace. 
As the maiden activity of the association, spirits were very high. All efforts were very pure and focused. The association was able to register a massive success. According to some principals and other personnel, the association was doing what the country really needed at this crucial moment. Some described the activity as very humanly-rewarding. Heaps of praises were sent to the association. Clearly, meeting a target of over five thousand (5000) students; over two hundred students; and a diverse audience was a goal worthy of achieving, and that was what the association exactly did! Amazingly, this daunting and expensive activity was funded by the members of the association themselves from their individual pockets. It was an absolute sacrifice from the whole team.
