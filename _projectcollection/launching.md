### YOMEVA Launching

Youths' Movement for Employment and Violence-free Africa is a continental youth-led organisation that seeks to address youth unemployment issues and promote unity and  peaceful co-existence in African Continent through meaningful engagements with relevant authorities, as well as advocacy programmes. 

We are two years old in the space of activism with enormous gains registered. 

We are poised to officially launch the organisation on Saturday 9th February, 2019 on the theme: " Ending Youth Unemployment for a Sustainable Peace and Development in Africa."
